Water utilities need methods for predicting and detecting such leaks before they become big breaks, so that they can perform preventative maintenance. Effective ways can be sending robots into the network to perform detection task or implementing sensors along pipes to achieve real-time health monitoring and prognostics.

It is being developed by MIT and NASA\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) to demonstrate, for the first time, In-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU) technologies on another planet by extracting O2\xa0from CO2\xa0in the Martian atmosphere using solid oxide electrolysis (SOE). In order to inform and control its system, MOXIE has a set of temperature, pressure, and composition sensors that measure its internal gas flows. The four composition sensors present are all commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware and include an oxygen sensor, 0 – 100% and a carbon dioxide sensor, 0 – 5% for the output gas stream from the SOE anode and another carbon monoxide sensor, 0 – 100% and a carbon dioxide sensor, 0 – 100% for the cathode. All of these composition sensors, except the luminescence oxygen sensor, are Non-Dispersive Infrared Radiation (NDIR) sensors that use Beer’s law for their readings. However, these sensors are produced for Earth-ambient-conditions, and thus they lack any data that predict their behavior under Mars-like conditions. This research involves a series of tests under a range of temperatures, pressures and concentrations in order to properly calibrate and characterize (C&amp;C) the sensors to understand their future behavior on Mars. In order to simulate Mars’s conditions and conduct the mentioned C&amp;C tests, this research involved designing and constructing a small temperature-controlled vacuum chamber. Following a set test plan, numerous sensor readings will be recorded while varying the chamber gas composition, pressure and temperature. The main motivation behind these tests is to decode the proprietary algorithms that govern the sensor composition readings, which involves employing a modified version of Beer’s law. Additionally, these tests are important for gaining a better understanding about the sensors’ response time, aging, degradation, and cross-sensitivity between different gases. Thus this research helps in characterizing and calibrating the MOXIE sensors prior to their flight on the Mars 2020 rover in order to ensure full understanding of their readings.</p><p><b>Any prerequisites or requirements for the position:\xa0</b> Preferred: AeroAstro background; experience with hardware, testing and experimentation; statistics and data analysis, LabView experience\xa0</p><ul><li>Maya Nasr, Graduate Student: <a href="mailto:mayanasr@mit.edu">mayanasr@mit.edu</a></li>\n<li>Eric Hinterman, Graduate Student:\xa0<a href="mailto:erichint@mit.edu">erichint@mit.e</a>du</li>\n</ul>', 'contact': ''}, {'date': '2/5/19', 'term': 'Spring', 'department': 'Anthropology (Course 21A)', 'supervisor': ' Susan S.

The interface of nanomaterials and plants, also described as plant nanobionics, can equip the latter with novel and augmented functions such as environmental sensing, light emission and increased crop production. The Strano Lab in MIT is a pioneer in plant nanobionics research, with light-emitting plants and explosive-sensing plants that can send an e-mail upon analyte detection as our most recent achievements.</p><p>We are currently attempting to utilize single-walled carbon nanotube (SWNTs) to deliver genetic materials to the pollen of oil palm plants for plant genetic engineering. Pollen contains the male gametes (sperm cells) necessary for plant reproduction and breeding. By delivering genetic materials into the pollen, we can modify the nuclear genome to code beneficial traits, such as drought or disease resistance, which can then be passed to the offspring, However, pollen is coated with one of the most inert biopolymers ever made in nature called sporopollenin, rendering the current method to deliver genetic materials past the pollen cell wall ineffective. We have previously shown that SWNTs can passively traffic past the plant cell wall, cell membrane and even the double lipid bilayers of chloroplast. Our preliminary experiments indicate that SWNTs can also penetrate past the sporopollenin. This suggests that SWNTs can potentially be used as nanocarriers to deliver biomaterial into the pollen grains without the need of high energy input or chemically destructive method.</p><p>As a student of this project, you will be assisting in preparing various functionalized SWNTs with different conjugation chemistry strategies. You will also be evaluating their efficiency in binding and delivering genetic materials into plant materials, and their effect on pollen germination rate or health. You will be exposed to different areas of research such as nanotechnology, material science and plant biology, with tasks ranging from synthesizing the nanocarriers to evaluating how these nanocarriers interact with pollen materials. There are also opportunities to get involved in side projects such as studying how nanoparticle physical traits can affect its uptake into the roots of plants in microfluidic chips, and metal ion sensing using nanoparticle in plants.</p><p><b>Prerequisites: </b>We are looking for students who are responsible, organized, willing to learn and able to work independently.

Among various clean-up methods, oil extraction with sorbents is one of the most economical and efficient options. Recent work at MIT and elsewhere indicates that nonwoven mats made of synthetic and/or natural polymer fibers can be produced by electrospinning, and that such mats have smaller pore sizes for a given porosity than those made by alternative methods. Such materials are expected to exhibit strong capillary forces and good capacity for swelling. In previous work, electrospun polystyrene mats have been shown to exhibit higher oil retention than that of commercial polypropylene mats. The performance of mats made of polymer blends have also been studied. However, the kinetics of sorption and recoverability in electrospun mats has received little attention to date. The objectives of this project are to 1) fabricate a the porous nonwoven fiber mats by the method of electrospinning. 2) characterize the ability of the mats to absorb oil selectively from contaminated water, in terms of parameters such as sorption capacity, rate of sorption and reusability of the mats. 3) study the kinetics of sorption.

Greenbelts originated during the early 20th century in Britain in an attempt to stop urban sprawl through the protection and conservation of large surrounding landscapes, or “greenbelts”. Many greenbelts aimed at the total cessation of outward development, while others used them to selectively control the growth of cities to protect the ecosystem services provided by forested and agricultural areas. The capacity of greenbelts to capture and offset carbon emissions from cities has become increasingly important. Regardless of the reasoning, and despite their use in cities as diverse as London, Boulder CO, Melbourne, Seoul, and Frankfurt, no contemporary global comparison of greenbelt erosion and performance has been undertaken.

Human-based tracing is highly subjective, error-prone, and time-consuming, so this is an ideal application of AI. The results of the initial land-cover assessments will be used to calculate a number of dynamic urbanization metrics including development, greenspace, lost carbon capture potential, lost food production potential, etc. The results will also be augmented using techniques such as cellular-automata to test ways of aggregating areas of development to discover typologies of erosion.

This project applies all six methods in collaboration with a company based in Benin called Green Keeper Africa that harvests the invasive water hyacinth and uses it to manufacture products that clean oil-based waste. Green Keeper Africa faces a challenge to monitor the location of the water hyacinth; they propose to create an Observing System to track the plant. Space Enabled and Green Keeper Africa are collaborating on a multi-faceted research project that will harness all six of the Space Enabled research methods. The project uses design thinking to identify the objectives for an information system. The social science portion examines the historical, economic and cultural context. The complex system modeling activity builds a computer-based simulation of the community and environment. The engineering component explores approaches to produce new data about the water hyacinth.

Not so much yet on graph data, until very recently. Graph data is structurally different; it\'s all about relationships between data. Think social networks, gene expression networks, knowledge graphs, you name it - graphs are all around us. In finance we can think about trading, hedging, and asset management, supply chain finance and optimization, lending and securitization. Each of these can use graphs to capture relationships and interactions between different types of entities, often with a time series component, and often in a dynamic setting. The problem is, deep learning on graph data is extremely difficult computationally due to the combinatorial complexity and nonlinearity inherent to graphs of any meaningful size and density. And it\'s precisely the information hidden in that complexity that makes graph data so interesting and important. Recently we\'ve seen a rapid and exciting acceleration of work on graph convolutional networks, or GCN\'s, with special attention to the question of scaling. With GCNs, we begin with certain attributes to describe the nodes and edges, and we use convolutions over the graph to pull out the hidden properties and patterns. This is called node embedding and the objective is to achieve a better vector representation of each entity. In laymens’ terms, you can think of each node asking the age-old question, “Who am I?”\xa0 It’s really an existential question with infinite complexity, but we need a vector of finite length. So we have to bound the model or it’s going to take a prohibitively long time, and find a way do so without sacrificing accuracy. This is the challenge of scalability. Earlier this year at ICLR, Jie Chen and Tengfei Ma presented a new method called FastGCN. This work was a big step forward on scalability. FastGCN was able to beat previous speed benchmarks by two orders of magnitude. It does so by using a variant method for importance sampling and by performing integral transformations in node embedding to account for node inter-dependency. Building on FastGCN, we\'re now exploring how we can further advance graph deep learning, and finance presents some interesting use cases; for example, the problem of anti-money laundering.</p><p>Organized crime inflicts human suffering on a genocidal scale: the Mexican drug cartels have murdered 150,000 people since 2006; upwards of 700,000 people per year are ``exported\'\' in a human trafficking industry enslaving an estimated 40 million people. These nefarious industries rely on sophisticated money laundering schemes to operate. Despite tremendous resources dedicated to anti-money laundering (AML) only a tiny fraction of illicit activity is prevented. The research community can help.</p><p>We will explore baseline models as well as advanced graph-based models, which use more discriminative features resulting from the graph structure for identifying outliers.

In such scenarios, taking advantages of related problem-solving knowledge acquired by others to improve one\'s problem-solving efficacy is essential to achieve the first step towards human-like intelligence: collaborative and communicable AI systems that automatically learn from shared experience and generalizing the learned knowledge to solve related tasks more efficiently. In traditional machine learning literature, this idea has been extensively investigated in the context of transfer learning or domain adaptation where one takes advantage of available and abundant data from related domains to improve the predictive accuracy in a target task. This body of literature is, however, restricted to the domain of predictive analytics and centralized learning where data are centralized in a single machine and predictive model\'s architectures are revealed publicly, which ascertains the feasibility of knowledge transfer.</p><p>However, in many practical settings, centralizing data and publicizing model architectures are not desirable due to privacy concerns. In fact, even having a centralized machine only to handle communication across local machines is also not preferable as it would expose a single choke point for operational failure and place severe computational bottlenecks on the central machine\'s storage, communication and computation capacities. Furthermore, in the specific context of black-box optimization, which forms the core of most ML systems (e.g., hyper-parameter tuning in predictive analytic systems and/or optimal action planning in prescriptive analytic systems etc.), problem-specific data are rarely available prior to the onset of the optimization process and not surprisingly, most existing optimizing approaches (ranging from traditional to black-box paradigms) have neglected this re-usability aspect of past experience. In other words, problem-solving systems in such settings do not communicate and do not improve their efficacy with experience. In this regard, it is worth mentioning that in many practical applications, involving time sensitive actions and/or high cost of evaluations, ignoring the knowledge gained from related optimization experiences can lead to deleterious computational overheads in the re-exploration of similar parameter spaces.</p><p>With the above, any successful problem-solving systems is expected to operate independently and collaboratively via peer-to-peer communication. In essence, such systems need to be capable of consolidating, streaming and circulating their individual observational experiences between optimization tasks and among themselves. Therefore, the main objective of this proposal is to develop novel computational capabilities featuring efficient collective knowledge (expressed in the form of learned models of recurring optimization patterns) assimilation across different systems (that can communicate in peer-to-peer fashion) for improved efficacy in problem-solving. Specifically, this research focuses on a class of decentralized, communicable black-box optimization algorithms which are designed to optimize multiple non-differentiable learning objectives concurrently and collaboratively via communication.</p><p>The result of this research project is expected to impact a wide range of industrial applications that align with the specific goal of enhancing productivity in problem-solving and autonomous decision-making through human-like knowledge transfer across problems, which forms the backbone of many AI-empowered decision support systems.</p><p>A general-purpose collective black-box optimization framework, together with associated software prototypes, realizing the aforementioned notion of knowledge transfer in the context of decentralized multi-task learning.
