Usually, a city government has to go through foreclosure or code enforcement process before taking action on these problematic properties. However, due to a lack of plans, cities’ corresponding strategies toward vacant and abandoned properties have been critiqued for their justice and efficiency.Since 2014, City of Youngstown, Ohio, started releasing multiple Neighborhood Action Plans (NAPs), to guide demolition of vacant housing at the neighborhood scale. These plans are novel because they designated parcel-level suggestions for demolition and other actives. The proposed study will examine, Were these plans implemented? If so, how and why?The study, headed by Professor Brent Ryan and in collaboration with former Visiting PhD student Shuqi Gao of Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, will investigate spatial mismatches between the NAPs and the actual demolition, as well as differentiated implementation by the county land bank and city government, the two major actors of the plan implementation. The proposed research will a) conduct interviews, b) analyze spatial data of NAPs and actual demolitions, and c) conduct a field trip survey to Youngstown.The UROP position is available for the Summer (20 hours per week) and Fall (10 hours per week).

The diagnostic is based on the visual patterns that different skin diseases exhibit.Skin samples prepared at a laboratory can be scanned to obtain very high resolution digital images, called Whole Slide Images (WSIs).Recently developed deep learning techniques can be leveraged to perform classication of WSIs. However, there are two fundamental challenges to doing so: The dimensions of digital pathological slides and the lack of available training data.

Invariant object recognition, is one of the most fundamental computations performed by the visual system. We are interested in understanding the mechanism behind the emergence of perceptual invariance, by focusing on how neural representations change across layers of the visual hierarchy. In the high dimensional neural state space, variability in object representations can be formalized as object neural manifolds. Thus, invariant object recognition is the problem of separating unambiguously different object manifolds.\xa0This project is based on the assumption that sensory hierarchies in the brain as well as in artificial deep networks reformat object manifolds across the processing stages so that in the top layers they become ’untangled’, allowing for simple invariant computations by downstream readout circuits in the brain.Using the recently developed theoretical framework for analyzing neural object manifolds, we will analyze how neural manifold representations reformat in visual hierarchies in two important domains: the ventral visual pathway in macaques and the deep convolutional networks. Specifically, we will analyze the geometry of the neural data from different areas in the ventral stream, responding to different object stimuli with a variety of physical transformations, and compare with the analysis done on the representations from the convolutional neural networks. How do geometric properties of the real neural manifolds relevant to their separability change across different visual areas? Can we hypothesize the transformations done in the ventral visual hierarchy and choose and reject possible models by analyzing the neural geometries and using insights from the analysis done on the deep convolutional networks?

They serve as the child’s peer or mentor and take on different behaviors depending on the children engagement, making learning a positive experience for children in various settings.A child and a social robot (Jibo) play different literacy games on a tablet together. The goal of the games is to help children learn literacy. Sometimes, two children may play the game together. Sometimes, a child plays with the tablet games alone. Sometimes, one child plays the games with a robot. We will implement the above three interaction modes for the games.We will also implement personalization models and use various cutting-edge AI techniques (e.g., face recognition,. affective computing) to help recognize children's identities, track their learning performance and personalize how children can interact with the literacy games.• Responsibility & Scope of Work:Design, implement and optimize literacy games using Unity and C#.Program and hack Jibo (social robots) using Jibo SDKAdd interaction features to Jibo and design Jibo-child interaction paradigmTest and optimize the entire human-robot system architectureImplement a system that can keep track of children's learning performance and interaction history with the robot and the literacy gamesBasic data analysis• Personal GrowthBecome familiar with various cutting-edge techniques in the field of social robots Gain knowledge in how to do highly multi-disciplinary research at Media Lab.\xa0Practice programming and software engineering skills (C#, Python, Java, GitHub, ROS, API)Learn data analysisCo-author conference/journal papersRecommendation/reference letterInterview will be conducted before April 9.

Transcription of a gene is regulated by a network of distal non-coding genomic regions known as enhancers, and super-enhancers (SEs). Genetic alteration of enhancers results in deregulated cell states and disruption of SEs selectively inhibits tumor oncogenes, indicating their fundamental role in health and disease. Many cancer-associated enhancers and SEs have been identified, but two major limitations have prevented their discovery from translating into cancer therapeutics. First, genetic tools needed to identify therapeutic candidates among myriad SE-bound factors were unavailable until recently. Second—an ongoing limitation—is the lack of a methodology to elucidate the molecular mechanisms governed by the SE-bound therapeutic candidates. To overcome this remaining obstacle and spur the discovery of next-generation cancer therapeutics, we propose to develop a new single-cell technology to probe transcription regulation at enhancers and SEs at a single-cell level.To process the genome-wide transcriptional data generated by the proposed single-cell technology and to decipher the underlying molecular mechanisms of transcription regulation by enhancers and SEs, novel computational analysis tools are required. These computational tools will integrate transcriptional data generated by the proposed single-cell technology with information extracted from other transcriptional assays such as RNA-seq, GRO-seq/PRO-seq, and single-cell RNA-seq.

As increased pCO2 is largely due to anthropogenic use of fossil fuels and deforestation, seawater pH will likely decrease 0.3–0.4 units more by the end of this century. This, in turn, will result in a nearly 50% reduction in the carbonate ion concentration of seawater, making it more difficult for many calcifying organisms to produce or maintain their shells and skeletons. This research seeks to advance our understanding of the combined effects of pCO2 and temperature on critical aspects of shell/skeletal mineralization during the juvenile stage for three economically and ecologically important species of mollusks found in Massachusetts waters (oysters, scallops and mussels). This area has among the highest sensitivity to the potential effects of ocean acidification in the US due to its economic dependence on the shellfish industry and strong use of shellfish resources. Thus, understanding the impact of acidification on the early life stages of the mollusks that support these shellfish industries is our primary interest.At this point, our focus is to identify properties from skeleton surfaces (roughness, mineral density, structural pattern) that can readily account for those effects in calcification.

Unfortunately, most wood frame homes created in the US and Europe are built with the same static wood and plastic skins as buildings constructed in the late 1800s. In contrast, a smart façade is a breathable, high strength building envelopes designed and fabricated for tall commercial buildings only. The novelty of this project will be discovery of a new area of research mostly ignored by both the architecture and construction industries that affects ordinary home builders. A smart façade on a single-family house could redefine energy use, cut costs in construction and improve the environment by reducing or removing green-house gases. For example, a smart façade could eat smog, capture \\ energy from wind, driving rain or snow loads and support facade based farming. We believe this method of home surfacing can be made effective thanks to the development of computing and digital fabrication tooling. The grand challenge of this proposal is characterization and computation of a smart façade system as software developed for CAD. The first step in our work will be product development of a low cost, light weight smart façade system ready for assembly and installation on a small building. After, the design will be characterized as rules that generate façade geometry for any shaped or styled building. Rules will later be converted to algorithms that will decompose the 3D model into 2D shapes ready for digital fabrication with a CNC router.

Our wearable system includes a wide-angle camera, microphone, biometric sensors (HR,EDA, temperature) and a portable EEG headset. This data is combined with GPS, accelerometers (hand and chest) and tags provided by the user. The resulting dataset (~50 GB daily) will be analyzed to study relationships between human memory and the collected physiological data. The multimodal data is fed to a recognition pipeline (an end-to-end deep neural network) that models the relationships between different input signals as well as detecting meaningful entities from video and audio such as people, objects, places, actions, events, etc. The ability to find similar moments (based on the presence of certain entities and metadata) will open up a new way to interpret the EEG and physiological data in the context of everyday life given the longitudinal nature of these recordings. Our specific goal in gathering this dataset is to study memory in context. Some of the questions we plan to investigate are:Is it possible to predict the memorability of different moments from EEG, biometric data and the contents of recorded video/audio? Can we predict that a moment is going to be forgotten and use that prediction for producing cues or summaries for memory enhancement?Is it possible to find specific memories only using brain activity? For example, the user considers a particular entity (e.g. a person or a place) or event by just thinking about it. Can we identify what they are thinking about and then retrieve related memories (e.g. the summarized video) from that EEG signal in real-time?How can we apply the findings from these studies to improve learning and memory in people of all ages?A more speculative direction that we plan to pursue is the use of noninvasive brain stimulation. Since we can retrieve the corresponding EEG activities associated with a particular query or event, is it possible to steer the brain activity towards a particular pattern by silencing the irrelevant regions and elevating activity in relevant regions through brain stimulation, resulting in faster and more reliable recall?Machine LearningComputer VisionSensing and Data AcquisitionSoftware EngineeringNeuroscience', 'prereqs': 'Familiarity with one or more of the fields below:', 'contact': 'Neo Mohsenvand (mmv@mit.edu)', 'relevant_url': ''}, {'date': '3/26/18', 'term': ['summer'], 'department': 'Sloan School of Management (Course 15)', 'supervisor': ' Dean Eckles', 'project_title': 'Measuring and predicting with habits and intentions', 'project_desc': "Psychologists see habits as behaviors that occur repeatedly and relatively automatically in response to cues in the performance environment.
