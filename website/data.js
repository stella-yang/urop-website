This process collapses the channel data to a single line in the image.

The community’s excitement was bolstered by the potential of massive parallelized computation, at an incredible speed and with very low-energy consumption. The last ten years have witnessed the rise of massive data processing techniques and hard optimization problems, mainly driven by their numerous applications in operations and scheduling, drug discovery, finance, circuit design, sensing, manufacturing and social media.For these applications, the ability to process massive amount of data in parallel has urged on the development of new hardware, like GPUs for Deep Machine Learning implementation and FPGAs. While Moore’s law is petering out, the need for higher computation speed will keep soaring. The impossibility for conventional computers to solve large-scale hard optimization problems (called NP-hard problems) requires the development of application-oriented hardware. For instance, very intricate optical machines have been developed by the research community and by the industry (D-Wave). In this purpose, high-speed, low-power and massively parallel computation are required; three requirements for which FPGA architectures perform much better than their electrical counterpart.In this project, the UROP student will develop a new scalable, low-power and parallel FPGA process architecture designed to efficiently solve NP-Hard problems.

Because of the flow enhancement enabled by molecular confinement, carbon nanotubes could form the basis for a new class of nanofluidic devices for biomolecule (DNA/RNA) sequencing, energy-efficient separations, or ion transport and detection. In order to realize these applications, it is necessary to understand how water and other liquids enter carbon nanotubes, and how these filling events can be induced.As a student on this project, you will grow carbon nanotubes through chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and characterize whether they are filled or empty using Raman spectroscopy, a laser-based technique. While the project is quite open-ended, and I look forward to developing a series of experiments in more detail with you as we go forward, the project initially will involve testing CNTs of different sizes with different liquids and pre-treatments to optimize the likelihood of nanotube filling/emptying.You will have the opportunity to interact with many graduate students and postdocs in a large, interdisciplinary lab; learn important laboratory techniques including Raman spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, chemical vapor deposition, scanning electron microscopy, and more; and work on a project and in a lab with connections to medicine, energy, water purification, and nanotechnology.

In our lab we are interested in studying the physics of DNA with complex structures like knots and linked rings. These linkages represent an exotic type of non-covalent bond which has not been extensively studied. There is an enzyme called topoisomerase that can untie knots and unlink loops by passing strands through one-another. For this project, we will use topoisomerase to chemically unlink loops from the kinetoplast network and examine how it affects the physics of interlinked bonds.', 'contact': ['(aklotz@mit.edu)'], 'supervisor': ' Patrick S.
